//Plotter.js will take the numerical data, name and time stamp to make a data time graph. If the data units are similar the user can merge the graphs. Graphscale.js will ajust the vertical scale of the graph if the user decides to use a higher unit e.g user switched from mg to grams, Graphscale.js will also crop and ajust how much data the user can view vetically by default the user can see the previous 2 weeks of data.The color of the data will be determined by the colorId component. In the Viewing.js the graph being displayed will be of the data just recently entered at the top of the graph th category and subcategory will write in the format 'category/subcategory'. If there is a better way to do this tell me how (it'll be great if the user could pinch and open to manipulate the horizontal scale). Below the will be a list of all data subcategories arranged by category in a scroll view, there will be a sort button which will be at the top left which will allow the user the options to sort the data however they like.
