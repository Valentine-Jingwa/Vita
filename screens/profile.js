//for the profile page i want a profile pricture rounded which has a blue border around it. The profile picture should be in a circular frame and found in the middle of the screen. Use relative measurements for anthing on the screen. Under the profile picture there should be a button which has a name, age and group icon and left arrow. When the button is clicked it would take the user to a new page called Edit profile.
